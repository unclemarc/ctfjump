# ctfjump
Configs and container files for CTF jump server used to bridge from Internet to my lab

You need to install shellinabox: https://www.xmodulo.com/access-ssh-terminal-web-browser-linux.html - I have provided an example config file, to be placed in /etc/systconfig. This assumes that the ctf user exists.
